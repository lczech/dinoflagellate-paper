IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences 402ff1c02cf1114cb6b6cfe542997b9d276dedbd_2668 and 223ed0fe0e2696e07d5888992182926f8cdb6d2f_11 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file /home/lucas/Projects/dinoflagellates/01_align/papara_alignment.raxml.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 

Found a total of 239 taxa in tree file /home/lucas/Projects/dinoflagellates/00_data/reference_tree_dinoflagellates_rerooted.tre
